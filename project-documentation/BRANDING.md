# Branding Guidelines

## Brand Voice

### Core Principles

**Plain English, Not Jargon:**
- Say "How you decide" not "Decision-making framework"
- Say "Where you didn't agree" not "Areas of misalignment"
- Say "What slows you down" not "Organizational bottlenecks"
- Say "What you'd automate" not "Automation opportunities"

**Empathetic, Not Academic:**
- Say "This is hard" not "This presents challenges"
- Say "You're not alone" not "Many organizations face this"
- Say "Let's figure this out together" not "We will facilitate alignment"

**Real-World, Not Theoretical:**
- Say "Last Tuesday at 2pm" not "A recent time period"
- Say "Your CFO didn't agree with your CTO" not "Stakeholders had differing perspectives"
- Say "You spent 3 hours" not "Time was invested"

**Honest, Not Corporate:**
- Say "We don't know yet" not "We'll leverage our methodology"
- Say "This might not work" not "Success is contingent on various factors"
- Say "You disagreed" not "Perspectives diverged"

### Tone Attributes

**Confident but humble:**
- We know the workshop process works
- We don't know what your team will discover
- We're guides, not gurus

**Direct but warm:**
- No fluff or filler
- No false enthusiasm ("Amazing!")
- No corporate-speak ("synergies")

**Practical but provocative:**
- Show the data, then ask the hard question
- Point out contradictions gently
- Make patterns visible without judgment

## Terminology Standards

### Use These Terms

- **Alignment Sprint** (not "workshop" or "session" in marketing)
- **Battle Test** (not "simulation exercise" or "scenario planning")
- **Decision Framework** (not "report" or "deliverable")
- **Participant** (not "attendee" or "stakeholder")
- **Facilitator** (not "consultant" or "moderator")
- **Segment** (not "phase" or "module")

### Avoid These Terms

- ❌ Synergy, leverage, optimize, maximize
- ❌ Strategic alignment, organizational readiness
- ❌ Best practices, thought leadership
- ❌ Transformation journey, digital transformation
- ❌ Stakeholder engagement, change management
- ❌ Maturity model, capability assessment

### Segment Names (Must Use Exact)

1. Mythbuster
2. Bottleneck Board
3. Effortless Enterprise
4. Simulation Lab
5. Strategy Addendum
6. Pilot Charter
7. Provocation

## Writing Style

### Headlines

**Do:**
- "How You Decide"
- "Where You Agreed vs Where You Didn't"
- "What to Do Next"

**Don't:**
- "Strategic AI Readiness Assessment Results"
- "Comprehensive Analysis of Organizational Alignment"
- "Executive Summary and Recommendations"

### Body Copy

**Sentence structure:**
- Short sentences (10-20 words max)
- One idea per sentence
- Active voice, not passive
- Second person ("you"), not third person ("the organization")

**Paragraph structure:**
- 2-4 sentences per paragraph
- White space between paragraphs
- Bullet points for lists
- Headers for section breaks

### Examples

**Good:**
```
Your team agreed on the problem: too much time spent on manual reporting.

But you didn't agree on the solution. Your CFO wants to automate the entire 
process. Your CTO thinks that's risky. Your COO wants to start small.

That's the tension you need to resolve before starting a pilot.
```

**Bad:**
```
The executive team demonstrated strong alignment regarding the identification 
of organizational bottlenecks, particularly in the area of manual reporting 
processes. However, strategic disagreement emerged during the solution 
ideation phase, with various stakeholders expressing differing risk tolerances 
and implementation preferences. This represents a critical misalignment 
requiring resolution prior to pilot initiation.
```

## Visual Language

### Image Style

**Preferred:**
- Clean, minimal
- Real workshop photos (if available)
- Simple diagrams with clear labels
- Data visualizations with obvious conclusions

**Avoid:**
- Stock photos of "diverse business team"
- Abstract imagery (gears, lightbulbs, upward arrows)
- Complex org charts
- Busy infographics

### Iconography

**Use Lucide React icons throughout:**
- Consistent style (outline, not filled)
- Functional, not decorative
- Paired with text labels (never standalone)

**Common icons:**
- AlertCircle (errors, warnings)
- CheckCircle (success, completion)
- Clock (time, duration)
- Users (participants, teams)
- BarChart (data, results)
- FileText (reports, documents)
