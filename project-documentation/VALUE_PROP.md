# Value Proposition

## Primary Value Statement

**For facilitators:** Run executive AI alignment workshops without manual data capture, transcription, or report writing - capture 50+ inputs in minutes, generate insights in real-time, and deliver a professional decision framework in 3 hours.

**For executives:** See how your team actually makes decisions under pressure - not through surveys, but by watching yourselves work through realistic AI scenarios and getting a mirror that shows where you align and where you don't.

## Differentiation

### vs. Assessment Platforms (Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey)
- **They:** Send surveys, collect self-reported data, generate scores
- **We:** Observe decisions in action, capture live discussion, show patterns not scores
- **Why it matters:** Self-reported data misses how teams actually work together under pressure

### vs. Workshop Facilitation Tools (Miro, Mural)
- **They:** Digital whiteboard for brainstorming and sticky notes
- **We:** Structured segments with AI synthesis, QR-driven mobile submission, automatic decision framework generation
- **Why it matters:** Facilitators spend time facilitating, not managing tech or synthesizing outputs

### vs. Consulting Firms (McKinsey, BCG)
- **They:** Weeks of interviews → 60-page deck → recommendations
- **We:** 3 hours → decision framework → "this is how you decide"
- **Why it matters:** Executives want insight, not recommendations. Speed matters.

### vs. Learning/Training Platforms (Udemy, LinkedIn Learning)
- **They:** Pre-recorded content, certifications, knowledge transfer
- **We:** Live workshop, real decisions, team alignment
- **Why it matters:** The problem isn't knowledge, it's alignment. Training doesn't solve that.

## Unique Capabilities

### 1. QR-Driven Mobile Submission
- No login, no app install, no friction
- Scan → Submit → Done in <2 minutes
- 100% participation rate (vs 40-60% for email surveys)
- Real-time aggregation visible to facilitator

### 2. Battle Test Through Simulation
- Not hypothetical ("what would you do?")
- Not self-reported ("how ready are you?")
- Actual decisions on realistic scenarios
- Disagreements surface naturally, not forced

### 3. AI-Generated Decision Framework
- Not a readiness score or maturity model
- Shows "how you decide" based on observed patterns
- Highlights agreement vs disagreement with specific examples
- Generated in <5 minutes, professional quality

### 4. Segment-Based Structure
- 7 proven segments (not freeform brainstorming)
- Each segment builds on previous data
- Facilitator has clear run-of-show
- Participants know what to expect

### 5. Unified Profile System
- Track participants across workshops (without login)
- Facilitator sees history and context
- No duplicate accounts or identity confusion
- Privacy-preserving (email-only identifier)

## Key Benefits

### For Facilitators

**Time savings:**
- 0 hours data transcription (was 4-6 hours post-workshop)
- 0 hours report writing (was 8-12 hours)
- 5 minutes to generate decision framework (was 2-3 days)
- Total: 12-20 hours saved per workshop

**Professional polish:**
- Real-time AI insights during breaks
- Polished visual displays for each segment
- Professional decision framework output
- Clients see you as tech-forward, not pen-and-paper

**Scalability:**
- Run more workshops with same time investment
- Reuse simulations across clients
- Standard run-of-show reduces prep time

### For Executives

**Clarity on alignment:**
- Know where team agrees (95% cases)
- Know where team disagrees (5% edge cases but critical)
- Understand decision patterns ("we always prioritize speed over perfection")

**Risk reduction:**
- Catch misalignment in hours, not months
- Test decisions before committing resources
- Surface blockers early when cheap to resolve

**Actionable output:**
- Not a score or grade
- Not vague recommendations
- Concrete framework: "This is how we decide. Here's what to do next."

## Pricing Value

### What facilitators pay for:
- Per-workshop license or monthly subscription
- Unlimited participant submissions per workshop
- AI synthesis and decision framework generation
- QR code generation and mobile submission infrastructure
- Real-time data aggregation and display

### What they don't pay for:
- No per-participant fees (incentive for larger workshops)
- No AI training or prompt engineering (works out of the box)
- No custom integration work (Supabase handles backend)
- No ongoing support or account management (self-service)

### ROI calculation:
- Save 12-20 hours per workshop (facilitator time)
- At $200/hr consultant rate = $2,400-$4,000 saved
- Deliver better output faster = higher client satisfaction = more referrals
- Run 2-3x more workshops per month with same capacity

## Positioning Statement

MindMaker Leaders is the only facilitation platform that captures how executive teams actually make AI decisions in real-time, synthesizes their patterns using AI, and delivers a decision framework in 3 hours - not through surveys, but by watching them work together.

We serve independent facilitators and transformation leads who run executive alignment workshops and need professional outputs without spending 20 hours on data transcription and report writing.

Unlike assessment platforms that score readiness or whiteboards that just capture ideas, we structure the workshop, capture live decisions, battle-test through simulation, and generate a mirror showing where the team aligns and where they don't.
