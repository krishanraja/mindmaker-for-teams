# Purpose

## Mission

MindMaker Leaders reveals how executive teams actually make decisions under pressure - not through surveys or self-reporting, but by observing them work through realistic AI transformation scenarios in real-time.

## Core Problem

Executive teams struggle with AI transformation because:
- They don't know how they make decisions together
- Alignment is assumed, not tested
- Disagreements surface too late in implementation
- No one captures the "how we decide" framework while it's happening

## Solution Approach

Run a 3-hour "Alignment Sprint" where executives:
1. Surface and cluster their bottlenecks
2. Map what they'd automate vs what they wouldn't
3. Battle-test decisions through live AI simulation
4. Document their actual decision-making process
5. Receive a decision framework showing where they aligned and where they didn't

The output is NOT a readiness score or implementation plan.
The output IS a mirror: "This is how you decide. Here's where you agreed. Here's where you didn't."

## Why This Matters

Teams that understand their decision-making process before starting AI pilots:
- Catch misalignment early (in hours, not months)
- Know which decisions need alignment vs which can move fast
- Have a shared vocabulary for trade-offs
- Can spot when they're repeating old patterns

## What This Is Not

This is NOT:
- An assessment tool (no scoring, no benchmarking)
- A consulting engagement (no recommendations, no roadmap)
- A training program (no learning modules, no certification)
- A project management tool (no task tracking, no timelines)

## What This Is

This IS:
- A facilitation platform for running alignment sprints
- A data capture system for decision-making patterns
- A visualization tool for showing agreement vs disagreement
- A QR-code-driven mobile submission system for rapid input collection

## Success Metric

A workshop is successful when the executive team says:
"We just learned more about how we work together in 3 hours than we have in 3 years."

The value is the insight, not the output artifact.
